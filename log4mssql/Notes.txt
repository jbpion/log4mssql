The Logger checks the current config (default, saved, session, or override). 
	This config lists the appenders and their configuration Active appenders are in the Root section, along with the logging level.
	The user can override the logging level by setting it in the session.
The logger gets a list of active appenders that are at or above the in-scope logging level.
The logger iterates through the appenders, and invokes the procedure for the appender, passing along the appender configuration section, logging level, logger name, and message.
The appender parses the configuration and calls the message formatter. 
The message formatter looks at the configured layout and calls the layout handlers.
The formatter returns the formatted message.
The appender forwards the message to the logging implementation. This implementation could be writing to the message stream (T-SQL print statements), saving the message in a database table, or writing the message to a flat file.
